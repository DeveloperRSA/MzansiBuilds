# MzansiBuilds

MzansiBuilds is a platform that enables developers to build in public by sharing their projects, tracking progress through milestones, and collaborating with other developers.

### Problem solved

Many developers build in isolation and miss support, accountability, and exposure. MzansiBuilds makes project progress visible and collaboration-friendly. This is the "TryHackMe" platform for developers :)

### Target users

- Student developers
- Junior developers building portfolios
- Professional/Senior developers building side projects in public

### Core features

- Account registration and login
- Project creation with stage and support needed
- Live feed of developer projects
- Milestone updates and comments for collaboration
- Celebration wall for completed projects

## Tech Stack

## Extra Features:

## Team Collaboration Support

MzansiBuilds now supports the ability for users to create or join teams, making it easier to collaborate on projects. A team can consist of multiple members, allowing developers, students, or hackathon groups to work together within a shared workspace (note that the celebration wall is separate for teams and individual users to ensure fairness).

## Each team includes:

- The team owner/leader (admin)
- Multiple team members
- Shared access to projects and updates

## This feature makes the platform suitable for:

- Hackathon teams
- Student group projects
- Teams from different companies
- Startup teams
- Collaborative software development

The team structure is designed to scale, with future enhancements such as role-based permissions, activity tracking, and shared project dashboards.
